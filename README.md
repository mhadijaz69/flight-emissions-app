# ✈️ Flight Fuel & Emission Calculator  

This is a simple web app built with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) that estimates:  
- 🌍 Flight distance (between two airports)  
- ⛽ Estimated fuel consumption  
- 💨 CO₂ emissions (total + per passenger)  

The app uses [geopy](https://geopy.readthedocs.io/) for distance calculations and basic fuel burn rates for different aircraft.
